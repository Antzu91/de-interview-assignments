# Data Engineer Interview assignments

This repo contains sample data and code stubs for a number of assignments related to Data Engineering.

## Prerequisites

1. A compatible version of Python.
2. A text editor or IDE, e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Neovim (for extra points ;))](https://neovim.io/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The SQL tasks can also be done using a SQL editor like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).
3. Poetry for creating a Python virtual environment and installing dependencies (nice to have).

## Next Steps

1. Install the required Python packages. It is a good idea to use a virtual environment.
2. Open [tasks.ipynb](tasks.ipynb) or alternatively the numbered tasks Python files [task_1.py](task_1.py), [task_2.py](task_2.py), [task_3.py](task_3.py), [task_4.py](task_4.py), if you are unable to use IPython Notebooks.
3. Go through the notebook cells one-by-one and complete the tasks or alternatively the Python files.
